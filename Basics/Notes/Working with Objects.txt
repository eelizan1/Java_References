}

*if you had 'static' it would be a member of the class itself, not the instance 

Instance variables and methods will deal with information pertaining to the instance of the class 

String is a complex object - apart of java.lang.string 

String str1 = new String("hello"); // instance of the String class 
String str2 = "hello"; // they are the same

A string is an array of characters - a collection of char in a partocilar order 

String are IMMUTABLE - once you assign them a value you can't change them
